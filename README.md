<h1>Build a Tribute Page</h1>
<h2>Objective:</h2>
Build an app that is functionally similar to https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks. Do not copy this demo project.
<h2>User Stories:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Your tribute page should have a main element with a corresponding id of main, which contains all other elements
<li>You should see an element with an id of title, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")
<li>You should see either a figure or a div element with an id of img-div
<li>Within the #img-div element, you should see an img element with a corresponding id="image"
<li>Within the #img-div element, you should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in #img-div
<li>You should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page
<li>You should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab
<li>Your #image should use max-width and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
<li>Your img element should be centered within its parent element
<li>Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own personal style. Happy Coding!
